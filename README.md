# **ImageFurniture_API**

This project is a backend service for **Image Furniture**. It provides endpoints for interacting with **Decor8AI** services, such as virtual room staging, image upscaling, removing objects from rooms, and more. This API allows users to generate room designs, replace skies, prime walls, and process images in various ways.

## **Features**
- **Prime Walls for Room**: Prime the walls of a room to apply virtual staging or design.
- **Generate Designs for Room**: Create virtual designs based on input images, room type, and design style.
- **Upscale Images**: Upload and upscale images to higher resolutions.
- **Remove Objects from Room**: Automatically remove non-essential objects from a room image.
- **Replace Sky in House Images**: Replace the sky in a house image with day, dusk, or night sky options.
- **Upscale an image**
- **Remove Objects from Room**

## **Tech Stack**

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### **Installation Steps**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your **Decor8AI API Key** and **Base URL**:
     ```
     DECOR8AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
     DECOR8AI_BASE_URL=https://api.decor8.ai
     ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```cmd
   run.bat
   ```

   The API server will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
